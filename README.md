# Maxwell's Equations and Electromagnetic Waves

**Maxwell's equations** are a set of coupled partial differential equations that, together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, classical optics, and electric circuits.

## The Equations (Differential Form)

In the presence of media, the equations describe how electric fields ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic fields ($\mathbf{B}$) are generated by charges ($\rho$) and currents ($\mathbf{J}$).

### Gauss's Law
Describes the relationship between a static electric field and the electric charges that cause it:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

### Gauss's Law for Magnetism
States that there are no magnetic monopoles:
$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0
$$

### Faraday's Law of Induction
Describes how a time-varying magnetic field creates an electric field:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac{\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}
$$

### Ampère's Circuital Law (with Maxwell's Correction)
States that magnetic fields can be generated in two ways: by electric current and by changing electric fields:
$$
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \left( \mathbf{J} + \varepsilon_0 \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \right)
$$
